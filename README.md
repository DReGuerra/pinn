Description: \
This is repository contains a development of solutions to simple ODE and PDE systems using Julia programming language implemented in interactive notebooks. We use Julia's numerical and symbolic math packages to solve the problems presented in each script. The files contain more detailed descriptions of the source and usage of the packages. The goal of this repo is to build-up to a solution of these ODE and PDE systems using Julia's Physics Informed Neural Network package `NeuralPDE.jl`.
